## Key Concepts and Technologies

### React

- **React Components**: The website is built using React components to create a modular and reusable structure for each page and component. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient development and maintenance.

### Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js is used to enable server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO. This ensures that pages load quickly and can be indexed by search engines.
- **Routing**: Next.js provides client-side routing, allowing for seamless navigation between pages without requiring full page reloads.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Dynamic imports are used to efficiently load components and data on demand, improving initial page load times.

### Styling

- **CSS**: Styles are applied using CSS, with a global stylesheet (`global.css`) defining common styling across the entire website. Component-specific styles are applied as needed.

### Data Management

- **Data Files**: Data files in the `data/` directory are used to populate content on various pages. This modular approach simplifies data management and updates.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

- **`react-helmet`**: The `react-helmet` library is employed to manage the title of each page, which contributes to improved SEO by providing accurate and descriptive titles for search engines.

### Contact Form

- **Form Submission**: A contact form on the Contact page allows visitors to submit their inquiries. Form data is sent to a Google Apps Script URL using the POST method, enabling easy contact.
- **Asynchronous Request**: The form submission is handled asynchronously, enhancing user experience and preventing full page reloads.

### Styling and Design

- **Global Styling**: A global stylesheet is used to maintain consistent styling across the entire website. Page-specific styles are applied as necessary.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring it displays optimally on various screen sizes and devices.

### Structured Data

- **Structured Data Markup**: Structured data is embedded in the website to improve search engine visibility and enhance the display of rich results, such as site links and featured snippets.
